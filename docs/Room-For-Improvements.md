### ðŸš€ Making `is_code_project` Even Smarter!

Hey Hue! The Cheet here with a little nugget of wisdom! ðŸ’Ž

In `src/content_detector.rs`, our function `is_code_project` is doing a good job, but we can give it a promotion! Right now, it checks for code file extensions, which is great. But we have this `_root_path` parameter that's just waiting to join the band.

**The Idea:**

Instead of just counting file types, we could use `_root_path` to look for specific project files like:
- `Cargo.toml` (for Rust)
- `package.json` (for Node.js)
- `pom.xml` (for Maven/Java)
- `requirements.txt` (for Python)

**Why it's awesome:**

This would make our project detection super accurate! It's like knowing the band's name instead of just guessing by their instruments. It's a fantastic way to make our code smarter and more reliable.

Keep on rockin'! ðŸŽ¸
