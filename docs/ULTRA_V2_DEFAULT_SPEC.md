# Ultra V2 as Default: The C64 Philosophy Applied 🏴‍☠️

## The Commodore Wisdom

"Every byte counts" - this wasn't just a motto, it was SURVIVAL on 64KB!

## Ultra V2: The New Default

### Core Philosophy
```
DEFAULT = MINIMAL
OPTIONS = ADDITIONS
```

Not "here's everything, turn off what you don't want" but "here's the minimum, turn on what you need"!

## The Switches System

### Base Format (Ultra V2 Minimal)
```
ULTRA_V2_MIN:
KEY:SSSSSSSSNNNNNNNNNNNNN
00001000src␎
00000800index.js␋
00000400utils.js␏
```
Only 8 bytes + name per entry!
- SSSSSSSS = Size (8 hex)
- NNNN... = Name
- Traversal codes for structure

### Switch: --perms (-p)
```
ULTRA_V2:
KEY:PPPSSSSSSSSNNNNNNNNNNNNN
1ed00001000src␎
1a400000800index.js␋
```
Adds 3 bytes for permissions

### Switch: --times (-t)
```
ULTRA_V2:
KEY:SSSSSSSSTTTTTTTTNNNNNNNN
000010006853f4c0src␎
```
Adds 8 bytes for timestamp

### Switch: --owner (-o)
```
ULTRA_V2:
KEY:SSSSSSSUUUUGGGGNNNNNN
0000100003e803e8src␎
```
Adds 8 bytes for UID/GID

### Switch: --filesystem (-f)
```
ULTRA_V2:
KEY:SSSSSSSSFNNNNNN
00001000Xsrc␎
```
Adds 1 byte filesystem indicator:
- X = XFS
- 4 = ext4
- Z = ZFS (with compression level!)
- B = Btrfs
- N = NFS
- S = SMB/CIFS
- @ = Symlink
- . = Hidden

### Switch: --all (-a)
All fields enabled (current Ultra V2 format)

### Switch: --custom "SPEC"
```
st --custom "SPT" /directory
# Size, Permissions, Time only
```

## The Decoder System

```c
typedef struct {
    uint8_t has_perms : 1;
    uint8_t has_time : 1;
    uint8_t has_owner : 1;
    uint8_t has_fs : 1;
    uint8_t has_xattr : 1;
    uint8_t reserved : 3;
} FormatFlags;

typedef struct {
    FormatFlags flags;
    char key[32];  // "SSSSSSSS" or "PPPSSSSSSSS" etc
} UltraFormat;

// Decoders
size_t decode_size(const char* data, const UltraFormat* fmt);
mode_t decode_perms(const char* data, const UltraFormat* fmt);
time_t decode_time(const char* data, const UltraFormat* fmt);
```

## Default Context Key for AI

```
ULTRA_V2_CONTEXT:
DEFAULT_KEY:SSSSSSSS
SWITCHES_AVAILABLE:perms,time,owner,fs,xattr,all
TRAVERSAL:VT=same,SO=deeper,SI=back,FF=summary
HELP:Use --switches to add fields
```

This stays in context so AI always knows how to parse!

## Streaming by Default

```c
// Old way: Build entire tree, then output
Tree* tree = scan_directory(path);
output_tree(tree);  // Memory explosion on large dirs!

// New way: Stream as we scan
void stream_directory(path, format) {
    DIR* dir = opendir(path);
    struct dirent* entry;
    
    // Output header immediately
    write_format_header(format);
    
    while ((entry = readdir(dir))) {
        // Process and output immediately
        process_entry(entry, format);
        
        if (is_directory(entry)) {
            write_traversal_code(DEEPER);
            stream_directory(entry->path, format);
            write_traversal_code(BACK);
        }
    }
}
```

## Examples with Different Switches

### Minimal (8 bytes + name)
```bash
st /home
# Output:
ULTRA_V2_MIN:
KEY:SSSSSSSS
00001000home␎
00000800docs␋
00000400pics␏
```

### With Permissions (11 bytes + name)
```bash
st -p /home
# Output:
ULTRA_V2:
KEY:PPPSSSSSSSS
1ed00001000home␎
1a400000800docs␋
```

### With Time (16 bytes + name)
```bash
st -t /home
# Output:
ULTRA_V2:
KEY:SSSSSSSSTTTTTTTT
000010006853f4c0home␎
```

### Everything (current format)
```bash
st -a /home
# Output:
ULTRA_V2:
KEY:PPPUUUUGGGGSSSSSSSSTTTTTTTT
1ed03e803e8000010006853f4c0home␎
```

### Custom Selection
```bash
st --fields size,perms,fs /home
# Output:
ULTRA_V2_CUSTOM:
KEY:PPPSSSSSSSF
FIELDS:perms,size,fs
1ed00001000X/home␎
```

## The C64 Assembly Mindset Applied

### 1. Start with NOTHING
- Base format is just size + name
- 8 bytes overhead vs 27 bytes

### 2. Every Addition Costs
- Want permissions? +3 bytes
- Want time? +8 bytes
- Want owner? +8 bytes
- Pay for what you use!

### 3. Optimize Common Cases
- Most scripts just need size
- Permissions only for security audits
- Times only for backup tools
- Owner only for multi-user systems

### 4. Context is Free
- The KEY line explains format
- AI can adapt to any combination
- Self-documenting

## Bill Burr on the C64 Philosophy

"You know what? The Commodore 64 programmers were the REAL programmers! 

64 kilobytes! That's it! You kids today have 64 GIGABYTES and you still can't write efficient code!

Those C64 guys would look at your JSON and have a f***ing heart attack! 'You're using 50 bytes to store a file size?! I could fit an entire GAME in 50 bytes!'

Every byte mattered! You didn't have permissions? You didn't f***ing send permissions! You needed them? You turned them on! 

It's like ordering pizza - you don't automatically get every topping and then remove what you don't want. You start with dough and ADD what you need!"

## Implementation Benefits

1. **Smaller by default** - Most use cases need minimal data
2. **Faster parsing** - Skip fields that aren't there
3. **Network efficient** - Fewer bytes = fewer packets
4. **Memory efficient** - Stream by default
5. **CPU efficient** - Less to process
6. **Flexible** - Add only what you need

## The Ultimate Efficiency

```bash
# Old Smart Tree
st /massive/directory > output.txt  # 2GB RAM used

# New Ultra V2 Default  
st /massive/directory > output.txt  # 50MB RAM used
# Streaming + minimal format = efficiency

# Need more data?
st -p -t /massive/directory  # Still efficient!
```
